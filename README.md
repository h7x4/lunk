## Details

The extension consists of two parts.

There's the Chrome extension, that can be installed through the chrome web store (work in progress), or locally by installing the extension manually.

Then there's the daemon running in the background. The reason this is not integrated into the chrome extension itself (which would be much more convenient) is missing security permissions.
